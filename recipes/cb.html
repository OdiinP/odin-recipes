    <h1>My Cheeseburger Recipe</h1>
    <img src="./burg.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>So, this is just a basic recipe for a plain Cheeseburger. Hopefully it's easy to follow along lol.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground beef</li>
        <li>Onions (or onion powder)</li>
        <li>Garlic Powder</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Hamburger bun</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Take a handfull of ground beef and lightly form it into a patty. You don't want it to be too tightly formed because when it's loosely formed, it lets the cheese seep into the little crags/openings when it melts.</li>
        <li>Put it into a skillet after preheating it and spreading melted butter in it. Doesn't have to be too much butter since the meat creates it's own grease.</li>
        <li>Let it cook on one side for about 3-4 minutes and then flip.</li>
        <li>Repeat for the other side, but when the other side is almost done, take a piece of American cheese and set that ontop of the patty so it melts. Cover it with a pan lid if you'd like.</li>
        <li>Spread a little bit of butter on the hamburger bun and toast it for a little bit, careful not to let it burn.</li>
        <li>Afterwards, remove the patty and put on your pickels,mustard,ketchup,etc..</li>
        <p><b>Side note:</b>You could brown the butter while it's coating the pan or when toasting the bun to see how that tastes.</p>
    </ol>
